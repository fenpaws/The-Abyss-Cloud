# Protostar
The protostar fusion engine is a revolutionary new power source that harnesses the immense energy output of a young star to propel a spacecraft. The engine works by using a fusion reactor to contain and control the reactions taking place within the protostar's core, releasing the energy produced by these reactions in a controlled manner.

The fusion reactor is made up of a series of powerful magnetic fields that are able to contain the plasma within the protostar's core, allowing the fusion reactions to take place. These reactions produce a tremendous amount of energy, which is harnessed and used to generate electricity or to propel the spacecraft through the use of advanced ion thrusters.

The protostar fusion engine is highly efficient, with an energy output that is many times greater than that of traditional propulsion systems. It is also highly stable, with the fusion reactions being carefully controlled and monitored to ensure safety and reliability.

Overall, the protostar fusion engine is a groundbreaking technology that has the potential to revolutionize space exploration and other applications. Its almost limitless source of energy could enable spacecraft to reach incredible speeds and traverse vast distances, opening up new possibilities for exploration and discovery.
