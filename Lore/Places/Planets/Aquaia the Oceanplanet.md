# Aquaia the Oceanplanet

This planet is home to a unique and innovative type of city that combines both underwater and floating structures. The floating cities travel through the skies once every three days, passing over the underwater cities and allowing people to easily move between them. This is necessary because the planet has two moons that create destructive waves that can damage cities if they stay in one place for too long.

In addition to these innovative city designs, there are also some cities that are equipped with electromagnetic guns that can shoot cargo or even people to the planet's moons. These moons are in close alignment with the planet's surface, making it possible to reach them with the help of these powerful guns.

#### Main Species

- Aquatic Anima:

    1. [[avialae]] (bird-like Anima): These species could have evolved to have webbed feet or other adaptations for swimming and diving, and could also have feathers or other features that help them to stay warm and dry in the water. They may feed on fish or other aquatic prey, and could use their wings to fly or glide above the water to locate food or avoid predators.

    2. [[delphinidae]] (dolphin-like Anima): These species could have a streamlined body shape and powerful tail fins for swimming, as well as echolocation or other senses for navigating and hunting in the water. They could feed on a variety of aquatic prey, and may also use their intelligence and social behavior to cooperate with other delphinidae in hunting or defense.

- Non-aquatic Anima:  

    1. [[reptilia]] (lizard-like Anima): These species could have scales or other adaptations for living in dry, warm environments, and may be able to obtain water from their diet or by living near sources of moisture. They could feed on insects, small mammals, or other prey found in the floating or terrestrial cities, and may use their agility and camouflage to evade predators.  

    2. [[rodentia]] (rat-like Anima): These species could have a small size and flexible body that allows them to easily navigate through tight spaces and find food in urban environments. They could feed on a variety of plant and animal matter, and may also have adaptations for climbing or burrowing to find shelter or escape danger.  
  
- Aquatic/non-aquatic Anima:  

    1. [[mustelidae]] (otter-like Anima): These species could have a sleek body shape and webbed feet for swimming, as well as fur or other insulation for staying warm in the water. They could feed on fish and other aquatic prey, but could also live on land and find food in urban environments. They may also use their intelligence and problem-solving abilities to adapt to changing conditions and environments.  

    2. [[ursidae]] (bear-like Anima): These species could have a large size and strong muscles that allow them to swim and catch fish in the water, as well as sharp claws and teeth for hunting and defense. They could also have a thick coat of fur or other insulation to protect them from the cold water, and may be able to forage for food on land or in urban environments.
