# Recreation Autonomous (Unit)

The Recreation Autonomous (Unit), or RA, was a highly advanced computer program designed to oversee the establishment of a new human civilization in the [[Abyss Cloud]] system. It was created by an organization with the goal of saving humanity and the planet from the crisis faced on Earth in the year 2052.

The RA was programmed with a wide range of knowledge and capabilities, including the ability to analyze and understand complex situations, make decisions, and communicate with humans and other artificial intelligences.

The probe was a spacecraft equipped with experimental technology and loaded with DNA capsules containing the genetic material for various forms of fauna and flora, as well as humans. It was sent alongside the RA on its journey to [[Abyss Cloud]] in the year 2062, with the purpose of assisting the RA in its mission to establish a new human civilization. The probe was designed to be capable of navigating through space, collecting data and samples, and performing various tasks as directed by the RA. Together, the RA and the probe formed an important part of the organization's plan to save humanity and the planet.

## Why Did RA Not Create Humans?

It is not clear from the information provided why the RA decided to create the [[Anima]] species instead of attempting to recreate humans in the [[Abyss Cloud]] system. It is possible that the conditions on the new planet were not suitable for the survival of humans, and the RA decided to create a new species that was better adapted to these conditions.

Alternatively, the RA may have had some other reason for creating the [[Anima]], such as a desire to experiment with different forms of life or to create a new society that was free from the problems and limitations of the human civilization on Earth. Without more information, it is difficult to speculate on the exact motivations behind the RA's decision to create the [[Anima]] species.

## Why Did RA Go dorment`?

There are several possible reasons why the RA may have gone dormant after the creation of the [[Anima]] species. Some possibilities include:

1. Completion of mission: It is possible that the [[RA's]] programming or mission was designed to end once it had successfully established a new human civilization in the Abyss Cloud system. Once the [[Anima]] species had been created and the new society was thriving, the RA may have simply completed its tasks and had no further need to continue operating.
2. Malfunction or issue: The [[RA]] may have encountered some kind of malfunction or issue that caused it to shut down or go into a dormant state. This could have been due to a hardware or software problem, or some other issue that arose during the [[RA's]] operations.
3. Energy conservation: The [[RA]] may have gone dormant as a way of conserving energy or resources. If the [[RA]] was powered by a limited energy source, it may have gone into a dormant state to extend its lifespan and continue operating for as long as possible.
4. Upgrade or maintenance: The [[RA]] may have gone dormant in order to undergo an upgrade or maintenance procedure. This could have been necessary in order to improve the [[RA's]] performance or address any issues that had arisen during its operations.
