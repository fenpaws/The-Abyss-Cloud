# The Abyss Cloud Cluster

## Preface - TL;DR

In the year 2052, humanity was facing a crisis as wars and resource depletion had led to a decline in quality of life. In an effort to save both humanity and the planet, an organization set out to find a new home for human civilization. After searching for a suitable system, they eventually discovered the [[Abyss Cloud]] system, also known as Abyss-2586b.

In order to establish a new beginning in this new system, the organization decided to create an artificial intelligence, known as the [[RA]], which would travel to [[Abyss Cloud]] and begin building a new human civilization. To assist the [[RA]] in its mission, a probe was created with experimental technology and loaded with DNA capsules containing the genetic material for various forms of fauna and flora, as well as humans.

In 2062, the [[RA]] and its accompanying probe were sent off on their journey to [[Abyss Cloud]]. Ten decades later, in the year 3022, the [[RA]] had successfully completed its mission and gone dormant. In its place, a new species called the [[Anima]] had emerged, comprising a mix of human and animal traits. The [[Abyss Cloud]] system was now home to a diverse range of [[Anima]] races, all descended from the genetic material carried by the [[RA]] and its probe.
