# Avialae
### Background

Avians have undergone one of the most dramatic shifts in their behavior since their introduction in the final Vector population enhancement wave, due in no small part to an overall discontentment with their lot in life. Seven centuries ago, the owl Vectoring attempt went horribly awry and left the birds with only four species instead of the usual five, and ever since then avians have had to deal with the quiet mutterings behind their backs about being the “cursed family.” Their tendency to twitch and move suddenly doesn’t help matters, and a constant miasma of vague suspicion has contributed to the family as a whole being somewhat eccentric. It manifests most commonly as an almost sociopathic disregard for the feelings of others when pushed to violence, and while Avialae are perfectly capable of living a normal life with other Vector families, they are almost universally known for going too far. The trick is, the things that can set one off are completely different from bird to bird.

Seven people died during the production stages of family Avialae. Five human scientists, two Vector scientists. Murdered. Mutilated. Pulled apart like toys by the hands of an eerie, hunched monster wrought from nightmares. It was the first Owl prototype, and it had not emerged as programmed. When the other incubating owl Vectors were seen to be undergoing the same horrific mutation, they were terminated before they could be completed. The species was abandoned, and all evidence of the killings made by the owl Vector, including the sole surveillance video of the deaths and the photographs of the cryptic, twisted scripture written on the walls with what remained of the victims, was quietly swept away.

Careful media manipulation hid the nature of the owl massacre from the public, but there was no hiding the deaths themselves, or the loss of an entire species and subspecies selection from a family. It was chalked up to an error in the genome and an unfortunate lab accident, but Omega Generation was not supposed to have these sorts of errors. That was one of the key points of the third enhancement phase. Billing the owl event as an oversight helped hide a far more disturbing issue, but it hurt the overall reliability of the Omega project. When owls turned out to be the only stand-out issue, family Avialae in general ended up adopting the majority of that misplaced suspicion. 700 years later, some people still consider the family to be an accident waiting to happen.

Genetically, there is no issue with family Avialae. What happened to the owls so many years ago was the result of human tampering, using forces they did not understand. And while the owl event itself was brief and brutal, its repercussions would linger in Sol to the present day. The glyphs etched in blood on the laboratory wall marked Mars’s first encounter with an entity that had already changed the landscape of Earth years before, when it had intervened during the war and left the planet in ruin. It would be centuries before a true comprehension of its nature was established, but the loss of the owls got it an image in a file, a first report, and opened eyes to the possibility of a more insidious force from Earth than was previously imagined.

When the bunker on Earth was breached for the first time during the Luna/Earth landing operation and twisted, bloody scripture was found adorning its walls, MarsCo publicly announced failure with any form of recognition software. Privately, a few shaken scientists were sitting in a cold room with cups of day-old coffee, staring at a picture of a monstrously mutated owl Vector who had etched glyphs into a wall with the entrails of its victims, and trying desperately to figure out how the same marks and patterns could be splashed onto a bunker that hadn’t seen daylight in over three centuries, on a planet over a hundred million miles away.

### Appearance

Avians vary in posture more dramatically than most families depending on their leg configuration.

- Plantigrade avians are typically on the short end of the human scale, around 5’5”, though they can be larger.
- Digitigrades hunch more than others and their tail feathers counterbalance them, typically making them appear shorter despite roughly equivalent mass.

The family Avialae thinks highly of its taurs, called “angels,” as they fly better than typical Avialae do. It’s not inthe nature of the birds to value things that fit in with everyone else.

Avialae wings are among the more peculiar traits of their family. They’re extensions of their arms, and the leading feathers possess unique dexterity that was specially manufactured into the race rather than adapted from some terrestrial quality.

The result is the ability to form almost hand-like shapes with their wingtips, which they use for most casual gesticulation.
Their real hands are located where one would expect them to be and function normally, with these large “finger” feathers extending further outward.
