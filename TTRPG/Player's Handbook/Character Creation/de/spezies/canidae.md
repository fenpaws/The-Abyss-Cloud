# Canidae
### Background

Canines were the first family to be Vectored, and they’re well aware of it. Not that they’re known for rubbing anyone’s face in the fact _(it’s a little odd to openly brag about an arbitrary decision made nearly a thousand years ago)_, but most canines are raised with the impression that they come from a noble heritage.
They have the highest overall population of the various Vector families, though not necessarily all in one place, and many secretly (or not so secretly) consider themselves the _"default appearance"_ for the race as a whole.
More than one heated argument has sprung from _“The Vector Race"__ being summarized by an image of a canine Vector on news broadcasts or in educational media, for which many an apology is often made, followed by the usual argument of _"well, they do have the most numbers!"_ The fact of the matter is that a system-wide census hasn’t actually been attempted in centuries due to the sheer inaccuracy of such methods, and while CorporNations certainly keep track of who and what is working for them, they don’t often share the information with others.
It’s anyone’s guess as to how many of what is really walking around out there.

With a large population comes substantial diversity, and within the Canidae family there are multiple subspecies with dramatically different quirks and habits. While this is true of most Vector families, Canidae has the largest spread within each of its species, with dozens of subs in each one. There are over 50 varieties of domesticated canine species Vectors, half a dozen wolves, dozens of foxes, and so on. Within the collective mass of _"canine,"_ it can actually be rather difficult to find one’s own identity.

Canidae perhaps best exemplifies the Vector quandary: the fact that Vectors are not the animals they resemble but are humans rebuilt from the ground up. Each has their own personality, their own needs, wants, and dreams, and among the countless millions of Canidae members it’s impossible to begin assigning behavioral expectations to any one group without inevitably misrepresenting them. They are varied. And although it’s taken the better part of a thousand years for them to really embrace it, if there is any unifying personality trait among modern Canidae, it is an appreciation for their own variety. Canines tend to seek each other’s company for relationships more than some of the other families, partially as a result of simple probability, partially because within the canine family there is a terrific amount of diversity that allows them to find what they’re looking for without needing to stray into the potentially less comfortable realms of other families.

As an unavoidable result of their sheer numbers, the family Canidae is more readily accepting of its morphism offshoots than the others, and canines possess some of the few tauric (Morphisms with a standard torso and animal lower body) and Lateral (Morphisms that maintained fully animal forms) models and celebrities.They tend to conform to certain standards, however. Perhaps as a result of being _"the example"_ of what a Vector should be, the Canidae family does tend to set certain expectations of breed body type within their ranks, which extends all the way down to its morphism members. This contributes to the proliferation of Lateral and tauric Canidae public idols: they have an expectation of what falls into the _"correct"_ proportions for that, and mass appeal can be found by conforming to them. It’s difficult to say if this is any more profound than humanity’s own standards of beauty in different cultures, but it’s more consistent in canines than in other Vector families. It may be due, in some part, to most of the surviving images of many Earth canines being from pedigree dog shows.

### Appearance

Canine characters average at human height and are typically characterized by longer muzzles and taller ears than most of the other families.

Specifics on fur length and tail appearance change on a per-species basis. While all Vectors tend to have body builds that vaguely resemble the overall mass spread within their own families, canines tend toward human norms.

Wolves tend to be on the larger side, with even the short ones averaging over five feet tall. Foxes rarely exceed five feet, with smaller breeds averaging closer to four.

Domesticated breeds make up the majority of Canidae’s numbers and fall the closest to human averages.

Canines have the most equal spread of digitigrade and plantigrade legs, and their comparatively large population means they possess some of the rarer morphisms in their midst.
