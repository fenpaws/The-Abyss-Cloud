# Reptilia
### Background

Of all the additions to the Vector line made in the third wave of artificial expansion, few were quite so profound as the inclusion of reptiles. Massive changes to the original model were required. They were adapted to be warm-blooded, their reproductive methods changed to allow for the birthing of mammalian offspring; even their lung structures needed dramatic redesign to compensate for their increased metabolism. It has been argued that reptilian Vectors have more in common with mammals than their progenitor species. The argument is typically pitched by mammals looking for common ground, as most of the family Reptilia couldn’t care less. They’re known for their detachment, which has stemmed from being among the most visually different families in the Vector race. Reptiles have emotions and passions like anyone does, but they’re typically slow to spark and analytical in their approach. Once set on a goal, they pursue it with machine-like dedication, and are slow to let go of ideas they’ve adopted as true.

Like Avialae, Reptilia suffered a devastating blow during its creation. Lateralism, the term used to describe a glitch in wave two that resulted in Vectors with fully animal bodies rather than their quasi-human ones, was corrected in wave three, but the reproductive adjustments in the hybrid prevention protocol that was created to replace the original mutt-reduction sequencing had to be programmed to allow for that body type as a potential and viable offspring. Vector-kind had accepted Laterals as a part of their species, and while there was always the possibility the condition would breed itself out through simple selection over time, the teams involved in Omega had sworn that it would not be made into an impossible reproductive option in the third generation. To program that into all Omega Vectors would essentially turn them into unwitting executioners of a specific line of their own kin and was deemed morally unacceptable. They would later flip back on this decision when raccoons were introduced, but in fairness, what happened to Reptilia gave them a good reason to rethink their decision.

All Vector snakes are born Lateral. Reptilia’s production team certainly didn’t expect that result when other members of Reptilia all emerged normal, but the interaction between the snake species and the Lateral flaw manifested as a supremely dominate trait in them. It could be shut off in-womb, and with proper pre-birth therapy snakes could be born with standard Vector bodies, but by default each member of the snake species came out looking like their animal counterparts. An entire section of a Vector family damned to an existence without arms or legs. And what was more, it was a substantial number. Snakes and their respective subspecies made up a solid quarter of the entire Reptilia line.

Differing reports exist as to why the snake line wasn’t simply scrapped and reworked from scratch when this was discovered. Most modern renditions claim it to be a matter of ethics and safety: the snakes already existed, and while they were only fetuses at the time the issue was uncovered, terminating them would have represented a rather substantial loss of life. In addition, a rework would mark them as the only Vectors to have a separate, altered version of the hybrid prevention protocol inside them, which made for worries about compatibility over time if anything ended up drifting. But the timing is a bit suspicious. Reptilia and Avialae were developed near-simultaneously, and the owl incident cast an extremely negative light on the Omega project. A second species-ending error may have shattered any remaining public faith, and some suspected they pushed ahead largely to save face.

### Appearance

Reptilia characters have the largest internal variance in shape depending on their species.

Some are humanoid, possessing smooth scales and a tapered head. Others are more hunched, standing on longer legs than normal and echoing their locomotion back
to times that predated even the humans that made them.

Their snake species is entirely Lateral with no biped variations, making them the only family with a normally undesirable morphism hardwired into their breeding pool.

Some have considered that evidence of poor design. Others would point out that, discounting that example, reptiles have the lowest occurrence of any of the other second generation genetic errors of any other family.

Reptilia characters can possess hair on their heads or lack it completely. It pops up in their gene pool at random intervals, and can even manifest on snakes.
