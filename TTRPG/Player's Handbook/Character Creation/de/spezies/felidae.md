# Felidae
### Background

Felines were second in line in the first generation of Vectors and sported the most females of the initial release. By _"most"_, read _"one more than the dogs."_ 700 years later, no one has any idea why, but the anomaly has helped produce an almost matronly bearing in the family. Felines consider themselves the unsung heroes of the Vector race and are more or less comfortable with that idea, rather than embittered by it. They have been a part of every major conflict, every major boon, and every major development since the race began. Of course, so 57 have the dogs and a handful of others, but they get enough credit already. Felines are known for ambition, trying to reach the top of their social or economic ladder and refusing to come down. Of all the Vector families, their social behavior most closely mimics that of their template race. They’re typically stubborn and strong-willed, and are fiercely protective of what they’ve earned.

Felines boast a population ranked just below canines in size, but numerically it’s only 3/4ths the size of the canine population. Where canines have a variety of species subtypes, Felines received a lesser selection. Dozens of domesticated breeds were included, but the large cat breeds were included in significantly reduced numbers. Tigers, lions, cougars, cheetahs, and several other large breeds were all included, but rarely with more than one variety. This has contributed to a sort of exclusivity that permeates the family, and even among the domestic breeds, Felidae tends to be cliquish. Curiously, this behavior does not extend to relationships. Birth records show Felidae as more likely to breed cross-species than almost any other family, even adjusting per capita. Some have surmised that it tickles that same tendency toward exclusivity to be the only feline in the family, or to create a situation where having non-feline children exists so that any feline ones born will be that much more significant.

Most Felidae members will deny this vehemently, and it’s certainly unfair to suggest a cat would ignore one child for another based on species as a rule, but it’s been whispered behind closed doors often enough to stick as a reputation.

Sadly, this perception, more than any actual behavior, is probably why family Felidae is so often associated with defensiveness and stubbornness. Despite their terrifically large population, they have a fairly well-defined image in the eyes of most of Sol, and many of them are plagued by it. Felidae has hundreds of millions of members, each with their own distinct personalities, dreams, and behaviors. If they act like they have a chip on their shoulder, it’s likely because Sol put it there when they were born, and they’ve had to wear it ever since.

### Appearance
Typically human in size and stature with shorter muzzles and ears than most canines, Felines experience more dramatic shifts in overall stance than canines on a per species basis.

Large cat breeds are thicker and heavier on their feet than the smaller ones, which tend to bounce a bit. The majority of the family is digitigrade, and their body language tends to be more recognizably feline than how much other templates are reflected in their families.

Felines have more representatives in entertainment than any other Vector family and are typically associated with overall beauty and, on occasion, overall arrogance.
