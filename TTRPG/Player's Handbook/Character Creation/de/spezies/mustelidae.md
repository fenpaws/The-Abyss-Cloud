# Mustelidae
### Background

Introduced during the second “golden” generation of Vector population enhancement, Mustelidae feature dramatically different behavioral tendencies across their species line. They can be quick, eager, and energetic or slow, stubborn, and vicious. They fit in well with canine culture when they wish to and can slink around the lowest levels of society a day later. They’re predictably unpredictable, and attempts to slap a label on them typically result in having to remove it a day later when they manifest some new personality trait you didn’t see coming. Universally, however, they react quickly to stimulus, with generally exaggerated results, and are more willing to forgo social guidelines for a chance at excitement than most other families. They’re also known for looking for trouble, and for poking what best remains un-poked.

Mustelidae features a massive spread of species builds and appearances, which contributes to a general openness and willingness to branch out into new things. Conversely, their family-wide need to move and manipulate makes them view certain morphisms within their own families as truly unfortunate. Taurs, specifically, are considered a more debilitating condition by most of the Mustelidae family, as it tends to curtail the lightness of frame many of the more weasel-shaped breeds treasure. Huskier breeds like badgers and wolverines look at it with a bit more affection among their own ranks, but the diversity within Mustelidae makes for definite lines as to what is okay for some and not others. Mustelidae is often thought of as a mixed family like Rodentia, if only because so many of its members are so different.

Mustelidae has a knack for being unpredictable, which has grown into a family-wide stereotype of reckless behavior. They tend to bite off more than they can chew. On the flip side, a lifetime of doing that and surviving to reach the other end tends to increase one’s chewing capacity, and most Mustelidae are very capable within their fields. Or partially capable in a great deal of fields. Regardless, it’s unusual for a Mustelidae to say no to a task they have some expertise in. They tend to be eager to show they can do it, which makes them at once an asset and a risk depending on how honest they’re being about their own capabilities. Thankfully, Mustelidae holds another reputation that supports their first one nicely: they’re eager to learn. Provided you can get them to sit long enough to listen, you typically don’t need to fight an ego to get to a point of reception. Even the stubborn breeds are only stubborn about things they know. They do tend to want things explained before they’ll go along with them, though.

### Appearance

Mustelids lean toward the short end of the height spectrum, with few exceeding five feet tall.
Badgers and wolverines are broad and dense, but still on the short side. Mustelids feature short muzzles,larger noses, and rounded ears, and their tails tend to be on the shorter side.
It was mustelids that popularized permanent fur-coloring as a cosmetic operation, and it exists so prevalently throughout their culture that its often difficult to tell whose is fake and who was born with it.
